A project for doing simple particle filtering in Python.
It can be used create some nice graphs, figures and movies.

List of files as a starting point:

settings.py
	- Adjust parameters here

run_generate_data.py
	- Generate image data to test particle filter on
	- Requires numpy, Python Imaging Library, Aggdraw
		
run_particle_filter.py
	- run_particle_filter

plot.py
	- Plot reference vs. estimated trajectory
	- Requires matplotlib

plot_timing.py
	- Bar plot of timing from the Sequenctial Importance Sampling with Resampling procedure.
	- Requires matplotlib

plot_histogram.py
	- Plot histogram of particle distribution.
	- Requires matplotlib

plot_tree.py
	- Plot tree of evolution of particles.
	- Requires matplotlib, Imagemagick.



If you want to make movies from the image frames:
`avconv -r 10 -i image%06d.png movie.mp4'
Here -r 10 means 10 frames per second.
